"The Ultimate Guide to 2D Mobile Game Development with Unity" Course Finished
This game's content is "The Ultimate Guide to 2D Mobile Game Development with Unity" course. It's a 2d mobile platform game.
The game includes in summary basic crossplatform methods, UnityAds' rewarded video, prefab creating and using, basic enemy setup and AI, map creating with using tile palette, basic player setup and loot system. 
I finished the course successfully. The certificate link:https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-2fb56e0e-c4d4-44ba-8965-66ab8eda1c63/ 
Cause the course is a little bit old, some methods are not up to date(like unity ads). I had to rewrite them by reading Unity's documentaries on my own.
